Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

[Features](#features)
## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
Fill out your answers to save them in a Readme.md file.  You can also use a default answer by just hitting "Enter" for the question about how to install the app.

## How to Contribute
undefined

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

[Tests](#tests)
## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
