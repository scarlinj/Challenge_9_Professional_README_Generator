THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

If you would like to use this program, download this repository.  After downloading, open the app through a Javascript reader - in the attached video I walk through using Node.js.  From the Node.js terminal, run the program by typing "Node index.js".  From here you will answer a series of questions and prompts to fill out the information in your ReadMe.md file.
