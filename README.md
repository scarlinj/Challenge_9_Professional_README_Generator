# Professional README Generator

[What to include in a professional README file](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

## Description

Welcome to the ReadMe Generator!  This is a command-line application that runs locally and accepts user input when prompted for information about an application repository.  At the end of the series of prompts, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and different sections ( Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions).

When you enter the project title, this is displayed as the title of the README.md.  After entering a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.  You can then choose a license for my application from a list of options and a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled "License" that explains which license the application is covered under.

Enter your GitHub username to add to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to your GitHub profile.  You will also enter your email address to be added to the section of the README entitled "Questions," with instructions on how to contact you with additional questions.

Clicking on the links in the Table of Contents takes you to the corresponding section of the README.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

If you would like to use this program, download this repository.  After downloading, open the app through a Javascript reader - in the attached video I walk through using Node.js.  From the Node.js terminal, run the program by typing "Node index.js".  From here you will answer a series of questions and prompts to fill out the information in your ReadMe.md file.
